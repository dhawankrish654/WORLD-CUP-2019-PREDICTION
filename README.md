# WORLD-CUP-2019-PREDICTION
A small contribution of a cricket Lover to the field of Data Science.

QUARANTINED IN CRICKET

As a begineer in the field of Machine Learning I got through many of the projects to built in the starting of my career and finally found the project in my area of intrest "CRICKET".
The world cup 2019 prediction is a machine learning based project which predicts the winner of the matches that had been played in the wc19  according to dataset of matches played between 2010-2019.

Predicting the future sounds like magic whether it be detecting in advance the intent of a potential customer to purchase your product or figuring out where the price of a stock is headed. If we can reliably predict the future of something, then we own a massive advantage. Machine learning has only served to amplify this magic and mystery.
Though it isnt the future but it gives an unbiased study to dataset and predicts accordingly.
DATA-
The datasets has been imported from kaggle which includes the matches datasets of the wc ann the fixtures with its results from 2010-19.
MODEL-
The model I used to predict is the RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER from SCIKITLEARN.ENSEMBLE which gave us an efficiency of 70%.
Prediction-
THe wc though already had been won by England, is the same predicted by our model too.


SO Dont hesitate to give your suggestions and feedback remembering the fact that its a beginner project and please leave a heart behind.
 UNTIL THEN......
